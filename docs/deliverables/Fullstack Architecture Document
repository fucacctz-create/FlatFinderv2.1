# Fullstack Architecture Document: FlatFinder Web2 MVP
**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** September 7, 2025

## 1. High-Level Architecture
The system is a serverless full-stack application built on **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**. It features a Next.js frontend, a Node.js backend using Firebase Cloud Functions, and Firebase Firestore as the primary database. This architecture is designed for scalability, security, and rapid development. Key business logic (authentication, payments, KYC) is delegated to trusted third-party services to minimize liability and development overhead.
