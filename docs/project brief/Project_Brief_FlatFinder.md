\# Project Brief: FlatFinder

\*\*Version:\*\* 1.0  
\*\*Date:\*\* September 7, 2025

\#\# 1\. Project Name & Slogan  
\- \*\*Name:\*\* FlatFinder  
\- \*\*Slogan:\*\* Housing Revolutionized. The Envy of Owners Everywhere.  
\- \*\*Mascot Concept:\*\* A friendly, helpful cat. The brand promise is to make users feel "safe as kittens."

\#\# 2\. Problem Statement  
The global housing market has become prohibitively expensive, leading to a generation of people (primarily those born after 1977\) being priced out of the rental market in major cities. The search process is stressful, inefficient, and susceptible to scams. Existing solutions do not adequately serve the needs of regular, working-class individuals seeking fairly priced, quality housing.

\#\# 3\. Proposed Solution  
FlatFinder is an AI-powered rental matchmaking service. It acts as a personal concierge, using a proprietary questionnaire to understand a user's unique preferences and financial situation. It then scrapes and vets listings from public sites like Kijiji and Craigslist to find "hidden gems," filtering out scams and overpriced properties. For premium users, it automates the process of contacting landlords to schedule viewings, removing the most time-consuming aspects of the apartment hunt.

\#\# 4\. Target Audience  
\- \*\*Primary:\*\* The "99%." Individuals and families living in expensive cities (initially Toronto and Vancouver) who are not high-income earners but are also not seeking subsidized housing. This includes artists, gig-economy workers, skilled tradespeople, and service industry professionals.  
\- \*\*Excluded:\*\* High-net-worth individuals seeking luxury rentals and those requiring subsidized housing solutions.

\#\# 5\. Unique Value Proposition  
FlatFinder's value is in its highly personalized, automated, and secure approach.  
\- \*\*Hyper-Personalized Matching:\*\* Moves beyond simple filters (e.g., neighborhood) to a deep, questionnaire-based understanding of a user's subjective definition of a "hidden gem."  
\- \*\*Automated Heavy Lifting:\*\* Handles the tedious tasks of searching, filtering, and scheduling.  
\- \*\*Scam & Quality Control:\*\* Implements a robust vetting process to protect users from fraudulent listings and ensure a minimum standard of quality.

\#\# 6\. Technical & Business Considerations  
\- \*\*Platform:\*\* Web application (Web2 MVP), with a Web3 version planned for the future.  
\- \*\*Monetization:\*\* Freemium model with tiered subscriptions (Search Blitz, Casual Searcher, Premium).  
\- \*\*Key Technologies:\*\* Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Convex (database), Clerk (authentication), Stripe (fiat payments), WalletConnect (crypto payments).  
\- \*\*Core Principle:\*\* Outsource complex, non-proprietary functions (payments, auth, database management) to trusted third-party services to minimize liability and focus on core matching technology.
